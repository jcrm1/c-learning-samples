# c-learning-samples
C samples I wrote to understand specific concepts while taking a C class and decided are worth keeping. 

There's a set of three files with "fibonacci" in the name- `decompiled-fibonacci.c` is taken straight from a decompiler and does not compile. `cleaned-decompiled-fibonacci.c` is a manually cleaned copy of `decopmiled-fibonacci.c` made to compile.
